- a Sponsored Links example

Default V10 profile and Covid19 are not necessary and are used only to show how sponsored links and an Home Page WebAppHTML Template have te be configured.

The Covid19 Home Page WebApp HTML Template is added to the Covid19 skin in the tab `Search Form` section `Custom HTML`. Please note that the CSS style is implement directly within the template between `style` tags

Sponsored Links keywords should be edited directly from the Sponsored Links configuration page but using the detailed configuration when clicking on the pen on the right of a sponsored link line. Keywords must be splitted by line to be considered as different keywords.


# How to use it ?

You can download the files from github directly. Keep in mind that the Default V10 profile and the Covid19 skin are here as example. In your case, you must use the customer profile and skin already in place.

To make sponsored links work, you need to build the sponsored links index when you're in the sponsored links configuration page.
